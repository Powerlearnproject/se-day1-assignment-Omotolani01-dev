#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications using systematic methods and principles.
it impoortance in technology industry includes
*Software engineering ensures that complex software systems function properly and are scalable, reducing bugs and inefficiencies.
* It drives technological advancements, enableing new solutions, products and services.
* Many Businesses rely on software for automation, decision-making, and digital transformation, making software engineering critical to business success.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering (late 1960s) : The term software crisis emerged to describe the growing difficulty of large , reliable software systems. This led to the establishment of software engineering as a formal discipline.
The Introduction of waterfall Model (1970s) : The waterfall model proposed by winston royce , become one of the earliest formal software development methodologies.
The emergence of open source software (1990s) : The rise of open-source software transformed the industry by encouraging collaborations, innovation, and shared development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

*Analysis - In this phase the project requirements are gathered and analyzed to understand the need of the user and stakeholders
*Design - Based on the requirements, the software architecture is designed.
*Implementation - The actual code is written based on sesign specification
*Testing -After coding, the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects or bugs
*Deployment - Once testing is compelte and software is considered stable, it is deployed to the production environment where the end user can access and use it.
* Maintenance -After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated , improved and supported over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and agile are two widely used methodologies in software developmentd but They differ in their approach to project management and execution.
Approch - Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (like requirements, design, coding, testing) is completed before the next one begins.Once a phase is finished , it's typically not revisited. for example Building a payroll system for a company where the requirements are fixed and the client knows exctly what they need.
While Agile methodology follows and iterative and incemental approach. work is done in small, manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting for 1-4 weeks.continuos feedback and adaptation are the key features of agile. For example, Developing mobile app with rapidly changing user demands, where the client might want to adjust features based on feedback during development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The role of a software Developer 
 A software developer is responsible for designing, coding and maintaining software applications. They basically focuses on coding, implimenting and maintaining software.
 
 The role of a quality assurance Engineer
 Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of a software by identifying defects and issues before product is released to the user.They focus on testing, validating , and verifying that the software  meets the required standards. He ensures that the software is tested thoroughly and meets quality standards.

 The role of a project manager.
 He oversees the projects from start to finish , managing resources, timelines and communication with stakeholders.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integreted Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control systems are crutial tools in software development process. they both significantly enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality. For example, Visual studio: A popular IDE from microsoft, widely used for .NET, C++ and other programming languages. It integrates tools for coding , testing , and debugging within one platform.
While Version control systems (VCS) enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously by managing and merging changes made by different team members without conflicts for example using a VCS( Git) in a collaborative project, imagine a team of developers working on an open -source project. They use Git to manage the project 's codebase, allowing contributors from around the world to make changes, submit pull request and merge updates without conflicts.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
Some of the challenges faced by software engineers includes
*Managing complex requirements
*Time management and meeting deadlines
*Debugging and troubleshooting
*Keeping up with rapidly changing technology
*Collaboration and communication in terms of working in teams
*Balancing technical debt
*Security and data privacy concerns
* Handling user expectations and feedback
* Dealing with burnout
  
 Software engineers face a variety of challenges as mentioned above from managingcomplex requirements to staying updated with rapidly changing technology. Strategies such as continous learning, regular communication, systematic debugging and balancing technical debt help them to navigate thses challenges and improve their productivity and well-being in the long run.

  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is a critical aspect of software quality assurance (SQA) that ensures the softare is reliable, meets requirements , and functions correctly.There are sevsral types of testing namely

*Unit Testing - This involves testing individual componenets or unit of a software application in isolation. and their importance is that it help in early detection of issues.it helps to catch errors early.

*Integration Testing -  This focuses on testing the interaction between different units or modules of software to ensure they work together correctly. This ensures modules work together. Even if individual units work perfectly, integration testing verifies that they work correctly when combined.

*System Testing - system testing eveluates the complete and integrated software system as a whole to  verify that it meets the specified requirements. It is typically conducted in an environment that mimics production as closely as possible. it importance is that it stimulates real-world use, by assessing the system's behaviour under typical usage conditions, helping to identify performance , security , or usability issues.

Acceptance Testing - Acceptance testing is the final level of testing perform to determine weather the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is usually done by the end user or client. The importance of this testing is that it ensures user satisfaction, It confirms that software works as expected from the user's perspective and meets their needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and crafting effective input prompts to guide AI models , like languge models, in generating specific , relevant, and accurate responses.
Importance of prpmpt Engineering in AI Interactin
*Improves output quality.
*Reduces errors and misinterpretation
*optimizes complex tasks
* Tailors AI for specicic applications
* Enhances user experience
  
  For example without prompt enginnering  
  Query: *Tell me about climate.
  Response :  The AI might  give a general answer that is broad and not very useful.
  * With prompt Engineering :
    *Query : Explain the impact of climate change ob global agriculture over the next two years
    Response: The AI is more likely to provide a detailed and focused answer, directly addressing the specific topic.







Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
